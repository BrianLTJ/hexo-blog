# My blog

This is the repo containing source code of my blog based on [Hexo](https://hexo.io/).

Normally, this site is deployed on Github Pages and my VPS.

There are two ways to visit my site:

 - [https://brianltj.github.io/](https://brianltj.github.io/)

 - [https://www.brianltj.com](https://www.brianltj.com)

If you are behind the GFW, the latter url linked to my VPS should be your best choice.

Right now, this site is under development, mainly on page design. If you have any advice, please contact me using issues of this repository.
